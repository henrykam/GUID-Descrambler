# GUID-Descrambler
This is a small Windows utility for reversing the byte-order of GUIDs. Some databases store GUIDs in reverse byte order for indexing purposes. This utility provides a quick way to obtain the reverse byte order representation of the GUID.

Enter the UUID in the GUID textbox. The output will be the reversed UUID. Click on the Copy button to copy the UUID into clipboard.
